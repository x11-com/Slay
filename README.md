===============

[Slay](https://slay.com) is an open source habit building program which treats your life like a Role Playing Game. Level
up as you succeed, lose HP as you fail, earn money to buy weapons and armor.

**We need more programmers!** Your assistance will be greatly appreciated. The wiki pages below and the additional pages
they link to will tell you how to get started on contributing code and where you can go to seek further help or ask
questions:

  technologies used and how the software is organized.
* [Setting up Slay Locally](https://slay.fandom.com/wiki/Setting_up_Slay_Locally) - how to set up a local install of
  Slay for development and testing on various platforms.
